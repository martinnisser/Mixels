# Mixels UI

## There are 2 main folders here:
The server code is in the ```\backend``` folder and the UI code is in ```\frontend``` folder.

The backend is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and the frontend is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

## Backend
In order to launch the backend, navigate to the ```backend``` folder and 

```python manage.py runserver```

The main code functions are within ```backend\sheet``` folder. In order to change the functionality, you can work with ```view.py``` file.

## Frontend

In order to launch the frontend, please follow the following steps:

- Install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)
- Navigate to folder ```frontend/```
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm run start```

This will install the required dependencies, and run the server on your localhost.
